# Pectin Effects on Gut Microbiota of Alzheimers disease and Obesity Mouse Models


This repository provides the scripts and instructions necessary to reproduce the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data used to investigate the effects of pectin-based prebiotic fiber derived from olive oil by-products on gut microbiota of Alzheimer's disease and obese mouse models. The analysis includes data preprocessing, quality control, and statistical analysis to explore the microbial community structure and diversity following the pectin treatemnt in the diverse groups.  To follow this repository you will need to have installed Qiime2 and R. The necessary packages for the R processing stage are indicated at the beggining of the script

* The **preprocessing.sh** file is a Bash script containing all the code necessary to perform data importing to QIIME2 and the denoising process.
  * For the original analysis this script was ran on a 
* The **pectin_effects_on_gut_microbiota.R** file is an R script containing the code to import the artifacts generated by QIIME2 and perform further downstream analysis.
